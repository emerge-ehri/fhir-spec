Purpose
-------
This is a ReadTheDocs project that is the source of the eMERGE FHIR specification. The eMERGE FHIR pilot project included the creation of the eMERGE FHIR specification and associated implementation use cases, listed below:

* `Generation of FHIR reports using the eMERGE FHIR Specification <https://github.com/emerge-ehri/FHIRGenomicsImplementation>`_

* `EHR Integration and Pharmacogenomics decision support <https://github.com/emerge-ehri/FHIRGenomicsImporter>`_

* `EHR Integration and Clinical Phenotype association <https://github.com/emerge-ehri/FHIRGenomicsProxy>`_


Sample FHIR reports created by implementation project are available in the Sample Reports folder.  

Documentation for the Specification
------------------------------------

You will find complete documentation for the eMERGE FHIR Specification at `the eMERGE Results FHIR Specification site`_.

.. _the eMERGE Results FHIR Specification site: https://emerge-fhir-spec.readthedocs.io/


Development Setup
------------------

`These instructions <https://github.com/emerge-ehri/fhir-specification/wiki/eMERGE-Specification-ReadTheDocs-Development-Setup/>`_ will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See build the documentation locally. All changes committed to this project will automatically trigger the build of the readthedocs.io project that publishes the `the eMERGE Results FHIR Specification site`_.
