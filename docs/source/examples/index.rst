Examples
========

From the inception, this specification was based on a process of analyzing several
reports from each of the two sequencing centers (SCs). A couple of those reports
were de-identified and modified to both protect PHI and demonstrate a broad
set of data scenarios and complexities.

Below are some of those examples organized by report with sub-sections that
are organized based on the hierarchy of the report message structure.

Downloads for the full message are available at the report level sections.
