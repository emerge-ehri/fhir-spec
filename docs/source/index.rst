eMERGE Results HL7 FHIR Specification
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The eMERGE Results HL7 FHIR Specification is a standard developed for the eMERGE network project.
It has been built to guide the eMERGE FHIR implementation project which will apply this
specification to a subset of the reports resulted from the eMERGE Sequencing Centers (SCs).
This FHIR Specification attempts to follow the implementation guidelines being developed in
parallel by the HL7 Clinical Genomics WG. The expectation of this effort is to significantly
inform the efforts of the HL7 CG WG so as to expedite the creation of a normative standard for
general practice in clinical genetic test reporting.
