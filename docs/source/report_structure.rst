Report Structure
================

The eMERGE reporting process is supported by two separate clinical workflows at the corresponding sequencing centers (SCs); The HGSC Lab at Baylor College of Medicine and The LMM Lab at Partners Healthcare (in conjunction with Broad Institute).

Below are two example (deidentified) positive reports one from each of the two SCs.

This section introduces the process used to convert and map these two similar reports into a common HL7 FHIR structure.


Mapping Report to Resources
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Below we show two sets of figures to represent the layouts of each of the SCs example reports at the top of this section and how they map to the FHIR resource model above.

First the HGSC example report layout and mapping...
